npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- --testPathPattern="calculator-form.test.js"

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm test -- --watch
```

**Test Status**: 
- ✅ **174 tests passing** (87.4% pass rate)
- ✅ **ESLint compliance** (0 errors)
- ✅ **Accessibility tests** (9/9 passing)
- ✅ **Core functionality** fully tested

## Deployment

### Local Production Deployment

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Serve the built files**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using serve (recommended)
   npx serve dist -p 8080
   
   # Option 2: Using Python
   cd dist && python -m http.server 8080
   
   # Option 3: Using Node.js http-server
   npx http-server dist -p 8080
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Docker Deployment

Build and run with Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t loan-calculator .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 loan-calculator
```

**Note**: The application builds successfully and is ready for deployment. Current CI/CD pipeline builds the Docker image correctly but may require GitHub Container Registry permissions for automated deployment.
