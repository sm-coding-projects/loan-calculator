# Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Loan Calculator application to improve loading times, reduce bundle size, and enhance rendering performance.

## Bundle Size Optimization

### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

We've implemented code splitting and lazy loading for components that aren't immediately needed on page load:

1. **Lazy-loaded Components**:
   - Amortization Table
   - Charts
   - Calculator Service

2. **Implementation**:
   ```javascript
   // Lazy-loaded components
   const loadAmortizationTable = () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "amortization-table" */ './components/amortization-table.js');
   const loadCharts = () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "charts" */ './components/charts.js');
   const loadCalculatorService = () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "calculator-service" */ './services/calculator.service.js');
   ```

3. **Benefits**:
   - Reduced initial bundle size
   - Faster initial page load
   - Components are loaded only when needed

### Webpack Optimizations

We've configured Webpack to optimize the bundle size:

1. **Chunk Splitting**:
   - Vendor code (node_modules) is split into separate chunks
   - Common code used across multiple components is extracted
   - Named chunks for better debugging and caching

2. **Minification**:
   - JavaScript minification with Terser
   - CSS minification with CssMinimizerPlugin
   - HTML minification with HtmlWebpackPlugin

3. **Tree Shaking**:
   - Unused code is eliminated from the final bundle
   - Configured in webpack.config.js with optimization settings

4. **Compression**:
   - Gzip compression for text-based assets
   - Image optimization for reduced file sizes

## Rendering Performance

### Efficient DOM Updates

1. **Throttled Updates**:
   - Form input changes are debounced to prevent excessive calculations
   - Charts are only re-rendered when necessary

2. **Optimized Rendering**:
   - Components use efficient rendering techniques
   - DOM manipulations are batched where possible

### Memory Management

1. **Resource Cleanup**:
   - Chart instances are properly destroyed when no longer needed
   - Event listeners are removed when components are destroyed

2. **Memory Leaks Prevention**:
   - Circular references are avoided
   - Large data structures are cleaned up when no longer needed

## Loading Performance

1. **Loading Indicators**:
   - Visual feedback is provided while lazy-loaded components are loading
   - Error handling for failed component loading

2. **Critical CSS**:
   - Essential styles are inlined in the head
   - Non-critical CSS is loaded asynchronously

3. **Asset Optimization**:
   - Images are compressed and optimized
   - Appropriate image formats are used (WebP where supported)

## Webpack Configuration

The webpack.config.js file has been updated with the following optimizations:

1. **Output Configuration**:
   ```javascript
   output: {
     filename: 'js/[name].[contenthash].js',
     chunkFilename: 'js/[name].[contenthash].chunk.js',
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Optimization Settings**:
   ```javascript
   optimization: {
     minimize: isProduction,
     minimizer: [
       new TerserPlugin({
         // Advanced minification options
       }),
       new CssMinimizerPlugin({
         // CSS optimization options
       }),
     ],
     splitChunks: {
       // Advanced chunk splitting configuration
     },
     // ...
   }
   ```

3. **Compression Plugin**:
   ```javascript
   new CompressionPlugin({
     algorithm: 'gzip',
     test: /\.(js|css|html|svg)$/,
     threshold: 10240,
     minRatio: 0.8,
   })
   ```

4. **Image Optimization**:
   ```javascript
   new ImageMinimizerPlugin({
     minimizer: {
       implementation: ImageMinimizerPlugin.imageminMinify,
       options: {
         plugins: [
           ['gifsicle', { interlaced: true }],
           ['jpegtran', { progressive: true }],
           ['optipng', { optimizationLevel: 5 }],
           ['svgo', { plugins: [{ name: 'preset-default' }] }],
         ],
       },
     },
   })
   ```

## Monitoring and Analysis

1. **Bundle Analysis**:
   - Use `npm run analyze` to visualize bundle size and composition
   - Identify opportunities for further optimization

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
   - Track bundle size changes over time

## Future Optimizations

1. **Service Worker**:
   - Implement service worker for offline support
   - Cache static assets for faster subsequent loads

2. **Preloading**:
   - Preload critical resources
   - Prefetch likely-to-be-needed resources

3. **Web Workers**:
   - Move complex calculations to web workers
   - Keep the main thread free for UI updates
